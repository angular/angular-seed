    <h1>Hello, I'm Eunice!</h1>
    <p>You may be wondering, "Why did you do this?" I moved to San Francisco with the hopes of becoming a full stack engineer at a meaningful, cultural company like Course Hero. As a fairly new developer, I knew I was up against some very experienced candidates and thought of how I can show my potential as a Hero. I decided to learn AngularJS, which is a part of CH's tech stack, and apply it to this site. Please look around!</p>
