# angular-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

The seed contains angular libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo (or download the zip/tarball), start up
our (or yours) webserver and you are ready to develop and test your application.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together. You can
check it out by opening app/index.html in your browser (might not work file `file://` scheme in
certain browsers, see note below).

_Note: While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend hosting the project files using a local
webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`._


## How to use angular-seed

Clone the angular-seed repository and start hacking...


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running the app in production

This really depends on how complex is your app and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted
somewhere, where they can be accessed by browsers.

If your angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and a webserver(s).


### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[JsTestDriver](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires java and a local or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test-server.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test-server.bat`)
* navigate your browser to `http://localhost:9876/`
* click on one of the capture links (preferably the "strict" one)
* run `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)


### Continuous unit testing

Requires ruby and [watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) gem.

* start JSTD server and capture a browser as described above
* start watchr with `watchr scripts/watchr.rb`
* in a different window/tab/editor `tail -f logs/jstd.log`
* edit files in `app/` or `src/` and save them
* watch the log to see updates

There are many other ways to achieve the same effect. Feel free to use them if you prefer them over
watchr.


### End to end testing

angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the [end-to-end runner's documentation](http://goo.gl/e8n06) for more info.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* open `http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html` in your browser


### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just
fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.
